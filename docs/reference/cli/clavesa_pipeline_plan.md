# clavesa pipeline plan

Run terraform plan on a pipeline

Run terraform plan on a pipeline.

Pipeline directory:
  Pass the pipeline directory as the first argument, relative to the
  workspace root (e.g. "my-pipeline") or as an absolute path. Omit it to
  use the current directory, which is handy once you have cd'd into the
  pipeline. Run outside any pipeline with no argument and the command
  reports a clear error.

## Usage

```
clavesa pipeline plan [pipeline-dir]
```

## Global flags

```
      --workspace string   workspace root directory (default: current directory)
```
